**DeepSeek V4 for Copilot Chat** is a VS Code extension that adds DeepSeek V4 Pro & Flash directly into the GitHub Copilot Chat model picker. You keep Copilot's agent mode, tool calling, skills, and MCP — all powered by DeepSeek.

#### 1\. Install the Extension[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/github_copilot#1-install-the-extension "Direct link to 1. Install the Extension")

-   Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 1.116 or later.
-   Make sure you have a GitHub Copilot subscription (Free / Pro / Enterprise — the free tier works).
-   Install the extension from the [Github repo](https://github.com/Vizards/deepseek-v4-for-copilot).

#### 2\. Get a DeepSeek API Key[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/github_copilot#2-get-a-deepseek-api-key "Direct link to 2. Get a DeepSeek API Key")

-   Go to [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) and create an API key.
-   Copy the key (it starts with `sk-`).

#### 3\. Configure the API Key in VS Code[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/github_copilot#3-configure-the-api-key-in-vs-code "Direct link to 3. Configure the API Key in VS Code")

-   Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
-   Run **DeepSeek: Set API Key** and paste your key.
-   The key is stored securely in the OS keychain, never on disk.

#### 4\. Select the Model and Start Chatting[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/github_copilot#4-select-the-model-and-start-chatting "Direct link to 4. Select the Model and Start Chatting")

-   Open Copilot Chat (`Cmd+Shift+I` / `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
-   Click the model picker at the top-right of the chat panel.
-   Choose **DeepSeek V4 Pro** or **DeepSeek V4 Flash**.
-   Start chatting — agent mode, tool calling, and all Copilot features work out of the box.

#### Optional: Configure Thinking Effort[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/github_copilot#optional-configure-thinking-effort "Direct link to Optional: Configure Thinking Effort")

In the model picker, click the gear icon next to a DeepSeek model to choose the thinking effort level:

-   **None** — fastest, no reasoning.
-   **High** — balanced (default).
-   **Max** — deep reasoning for complex tasks.

#### Optional: Vision Support[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/github_copilot#optional-vision-support "Direct link to Optional: Vision Support")

DeepSeek V4 is text-only, but the extension handles images automatically. Drop a screenshot into chat and it proxies through another installed Copilot model (Claude, GPT-4o) to describe the image before sending to DeepSeek. Run **DeepSeek: Set Vision Proxy Model** to pick which model handles image descriptions.
