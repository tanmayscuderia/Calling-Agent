[AstrBot](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot) is an open-source all-in-one agent assistant that integrates with mainstream messaging platforms such as QQ, WeChat, Feishu, and Telegram, and can be extended with skills, plugins, and MCPs to enhance its functionality.

#### 1\. Install AstrBot[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/astrbot#1-install-astrbot "Direct link to 1. Install AstrBot")

##### Install AstrBot via uv[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/astrbot#install-astrbot-via-uv "Direct link to Install AstrBot via uv")

For macOS and Linux users, run the following command to install AstrBot:

```
curl -LsSf https://docs.astrbot.app/install.sh | bash
```

For Windows users, run the following command instead:

```
iwr -useb https://docs.astrbot.app/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then initialize and start AstrBot:

```
astrbot init # Run this only once to initialize the environment. This command installs AstrBot into the current terminal directory.astrbot run  # Start AstrBot. This command checks whether AstrBot is installed in the current directory; if not, it prompts you to initialize it with `astrbot init`.
```

##### Install AstrBot via Docker[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/astrbot#install-astrbot-via-docker "Direct link to Install AstrBot via Docker")

First, clone the AstrBot repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot --depth 1cd AstrBot
```

Then, start the service:

```
sudo docker compose up -d
```

#### 2\. Configure the Default Model in AstrBot[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/astrbot#2-configure-the-default-model-in-astrbot "Direct link to 2. Configure the Default Model in AstrBot")

After initialization, open the Web UI:

```

In the left sidebar, open the `Providers` page, click `+ Add`, select `DeepSeek`, paste your [DeepSeek API Key](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) into the `API Key` field, and click `Save Configuration`.

Next, open the `Config(Normal Config)` page, set `Default Chat Model` to the model you just configured, confirm the selection, and click the save button in the bottom-right corner.

For the remaining settings, such as messaging platforms and skills, configure them as needed. See the [AstrBot Docs](https://docs.astrbot.app/) for details.

#### 3\. Get Started[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/astrbot#3-get-started "Direct link to 3. Get Started")

Click `Chat` in the top-right corner to switch to the AstrBot Chat UI. You can now start chatting with the DeepSeek model.

You can also configure messaging platforms to use AstrBot directly from your preferred chat app.
