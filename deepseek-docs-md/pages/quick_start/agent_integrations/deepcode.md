Deep Code is an open-source terminal AI coding assistant for the DeepSeek-V4 model, supporting deep thinking, reasoning effort control, and Agent Skills.

-   **GitHub:** [https://github.com/lessweb/deepcode-cli](https://github.com/lessweb/deepcode-cli)

#### 1\. Install Deep Code[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/deepcode#1-install-deep-code "Direct link to 1. Install Deep Code")

-   Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 18+.
-   Run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g @vegamo/deepcode-cli
```

-   Verify the installation:

```
deepcode --version
```

#### 2\. Configure Deep Code[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/deepcode#2-configure-deep-code "Direct link to 2. Configure Deep Code")

Create `~/.deepcode/settings.json` with your DeepSeek API key and model settings:

```
{  "env": {    "MODEL": "deepseek-v4-pro",    "BASE_URL": "https://api.deepseek.com",    "API_KEY": "sk-..."  },  "thinkingEnabled": true,  "reasoningEffort": "max"}
```

Get your API Key from the [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys).

> **Note:** The same settings file is shared with the [Deep Code VSCode extension](https://github.com/lessweb/deepcode).

**Configuration options:**

| `MODEL` | Model name, e.g. `deepseek-v4-pro` or `deepseek-v4-flash` |
| `BASE_URL` | API base URL, defaults to `https://api.deepseek.com` |
| `thinkingEnabled` | Enable deep thinking mode (defaults to `true` for deepseek-v4 models) |
| `reasoningEffort` | `"max"` or `"high"` — controls how much reasoning the model performs |
| `notify` | Path to a notification script executed after each model turn |
| `webSearchTool` | Enable the web search capability for the agent |

```
cd /path/to/my-projectdeepcode
```

#### Key Shortcuts[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/deepcode#key-shortcuts "Direct link to Key Shortcuts")

#### Using Agent Skills[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/deepcode#using-agent-skills "Direct link to Using Agent Skills")

Agent Skills are discovered from these locations:

-   **User-level:** `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
-   **Project-level:** `./.deepcode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

Press `/` to open the skill picker, or type the skill name directly (e.g., `/skill-writer`).
