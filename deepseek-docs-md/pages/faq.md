## API Call[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/faq#api-call "Direct link to API Call")

### Are there any rate limits when calling your API? Can I increase the limits for my account?[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/faq#are-there-any-rate-limits-when-calling-your-api-can-i-increase-the-limits-for-my-account "Direct link to Are there any rate limits when calling your API? Can I increase the limits for my account?")

For concurrency limits and capacity expansion requests, please refer to [Rate Limit & Isolation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/rate_limit).

### Why do I feel that your API's speed is slower than the web service?[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/faq#why-do-i-feel-that-your-apis-speed-is-slower-than-the-web-service "Direct link to Why do I feel that your API's speed is slower than the web service?")

The web service uses streaming output, i.e., every time the model outputs a token, it will be displayed incrementally on the web page.

The API uses non-streaming output (stream=false) by default, i.e., the model's output will not be returned to the user until the generation is done completely. You can use streaming output in your API call to optimize interactivity.

### Why are empty lines continuously returned when calling the API?[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/faq#why-are-empty-lines-continuously-returned-when-calling-the-api "Direct link to Why are empty lines continuously returned when calling the API?")

To prevent the TCP connection from being interrupted due to timeout, we continuously return empty lines (for non-streaming requests) or SSE keep-alive comments (`: keep-alive`，for streaming requests) while waiting for the request to be scheduled. If you are parsing the HTTP response yourself, please make sure to handle these empty lines or comments appropriately.

### Does your API support LangChain?[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/faq#does-your-api-support-langchain "Direct link to Does your API support LangChain?")

Yes. You can refer to the demo code below, which demonstrates how to use LangChain with DeepSeek API. Replace the API key in the code as necessary.
