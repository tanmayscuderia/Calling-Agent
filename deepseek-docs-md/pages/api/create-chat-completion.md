## Request[​](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/api/create-chat-completion#request "Direct link to Request")

-   application/json

### 

Body

**

required

**

**

messages

**

object\[\]

required

**Possible values:** `>= 1`

A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.

-   Array \[
    

oneOf

-   System message
-   User message
-   Assistant message
-   Tool message

**content** stringrequired

The contents of the system message.

**role** stringrequired

**Possible values:** \[`system`\]

The role of the messages author, in this case `system`.

**name** string

An optional name for the participant. Provides the model information to differentiate between participants of the same role.

-   \]
    

**model** stringrequired

**Possible values:** \[`deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`\]

ID of the model to use.

**

thinking

**

object

nullable

Controls the switch between thinking and non-thinking mode.

**type** string

**Possible values:** \[`enabled`, `disabled`\]

**Default value:** `enabled`

If set to `enabled`, then use thinking mode. If set to `disabled`, then use non-thinking model.

**reasoning\_effort** string

**Possible values:** \[`high`, `max`\]

Controls the reasoning effort of the model. The default effort is `high` for regular requests; for some complex agent requests (such as Claude Code, OpenCode), effort is automatically set to `max`. For compatibility, `low` and `medium` are mapped to `high`, and `xhigh` is mapped to `max`.

**max\_tokens** integernullable

The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion.

The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.

For the value range and default value, please refer to the [documentation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing).

**

response\_format

**

object

nullable

An object specifying the format that the model must output. Setting to { "type": "json\_object" } enables JSON Output, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** When using JSON Output, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish\_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max\_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

**type** string

**Possible values:** \[`text`, `json_object`\]

**Default value:** `text`

Must be one of `text` or `json_object`.

**

stop

**

object

**

nullable

**

Up to 16 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

oneOf

-   MOD1
-   MOD2

string

**stream** booleannullable

If set, partial message deltas will be sent. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events (SSE) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message.

**

stream\_options

**

object

nullable

Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

**include\_usage** boolean

If set, an additional chunk will be streamed before the `data: [DONE]` message. The `usage` field on this chunk shows the token usage statistics for the entire request, and the `choices` field will always be an empty array. All other chunks will also include a `usage` field, but with a null value.

**temperature** numbernullable

**Possible values:** `<= 2`

**Default value:** `1`

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

**top\_p** numbernullable

**Possible values:** `<= 1`

**Default value:** `1`

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

**

tools

**

object\[\]

nullable

A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

-   Array \[
    

**type** stringrequired

**Possible values:** \[`function`\]

The type of the tool. Currently, only `function` is supported.

**

function

**

object

required

**description** string

A description of what the function does, used by the model to choose when and how to call the function.

**name** stringrequired

The name of the function to be called. Must be a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or contain underscores and dashes, with a maximum length of 64.

**

parameters

**

object

The parameters the functions accepts, described as a JSON Schema object. See the [Tool Calls Guide](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/tool_calls) for examples, and the [JSON Schema reference](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) for documentation about the format.

Omitting `parameters` defines a function with an empty parameter list.

**property name\*** any

The parameters the functions accepts, described as a JSON Schema object. See the [Tool Calls Guide](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/tool_calls) for examples, and the [JSON Schema reference](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) for documentation about the format.

Omitting `parameters` defines a function with an empty parameter list.

**strict** boolean

**Default value:** `false`

If set to true, the API will use strict-mode for the tool calls to ensure the output always complies with the function's JSON schema. This is a Beta feature, for more details please refer to [Tool Calls Guide](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/tool_calls)

-   \]
    

**

tool\_choice

**

object

**

nullable

**

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.

`none` means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message.

`auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.

`required` means the model must call one or more tools.

Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

`none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present.

oneOf

-   ChatCompletionToolChoice
-   ChatCompletionNamedToolChoice

string

**Possible values:** \[`none`, `auto`, `required`\]

**logprobs** booleannullable

Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`.

**top\_logprobs** integernullable

**Possible values:** `<= 20`

An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

**user\_id** nullable

A custom user\_id. Allowed character set is \[a-zA-Z0-9\\-\_\], with a maximum length of 512. Do not include user privacy information in the user\_id.

-   user\_id can be used to distinguish user identities on your side to help us with content safety review.
-   user\_id can be used for KVCache isolation for privacy management.
-   user\_id can be used for scheduling isolation of users on your business side.
-   For more details on the user\_id parameter, please refer to [Rate Limit & Isolation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/rate_limit)

**frequency\_penalty** deprecated

This parameter is no longer supported. It will not take effect if you pass it to the API.

**presence\_penalty** deprecated

This parameter is no longer supported. It will not take effect if you pass it to the API.
